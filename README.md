This project allows me to practice creating a high-quality project.

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js**: You need to have Node.js installed. You can download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/). We recommend version 18.15.0.
- **npm**: npm is the package manager for Node.js. It is typically installed automatically with Node.js. To check if npm is installed, run `npm -v` in your terminal.

### Installing

Follow these steps to get a local copy of the project up and running:

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
   cd your-repo-name
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

This will install all necessary dependencies for the project. After the installation is complete, you can proceed to run the project locally.
